I made this code as my first try coding using nim

===================================================================================== 

COMPILING(BE CAREFULL WHEN PROGRAM STARTS IT ENCRYPTS EVERYTHING IT CAN OPEN, KEYS 
ARE RANDOM GENERATED AND THEY ARE NOT GETTING SAVED ANYWHERE START IT ON UR OWN RISK):
nim c <filename_of_my_script>.nim

===================================================================================== 

About:
  so idea was to make malicious encryptor payload 
  but it turned more like an experiment than smth serious

Why posting?
  it uses AES encryption to encrypt files and i saw only one forgotten post about 
  encryption using nim and this algorythm
  and i want to share my solutions i found during my little experiment
  
===================================================================================== 

Interesting things i found:
  WINDOWS DEFENDER SUCKS!!1!!!
    while i was testing on vm WD couldnt recognize threat UNTIL IT STARTED 
    ENCRYPTING WINDOWS FILES 

  I SEE POTENTIAL IN NIM:
    as i started writing my code i saw posts about nim innefectivness in malware 
    development sphere BUUUUUT they were from 2021-2022 
    as i recall SO I THINK NIM SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE 

===================================================================================== 




WARNING!
===================================================================================== 
U CAN ABSOLUTELLY USE MY CODE BUT I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MALICIOUS DOING WITH IT 
IM SHARING IT BC I WANT TO HELP PPL WHO MIGHT HAVE SIMILLAR PROBLEMS THAT I HAD
